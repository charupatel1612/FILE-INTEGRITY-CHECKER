## üìÑ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a Python-based **File Integrity Checker** developed in **IDEL (Integrated Digital Environment for Learning)**. It helps identify changes in files by comparing **SHA-256 hashes**, which act like unique fingerprints of each file.

In cybersecurity, it is essential to verify that files remain unchanged. Even a small edit changes the file‚Äôs hash. This tool simulates how integrity checking works using hashing ‚Äì a key concept in digital forensics and system security.

## üîß TOOL FUNCTIONS

1. **Save File Hashes**  
   Scans a folder and saves the hash values of all files into a file called `hashes.txt`.

2. **Check File Hashes**  
   Compares current file hashes with saved ones to detect changes, deletions, or missing files.

## üßë‚Äçüíª TECHNOLOGIES USED

- `hashlib` ‚Äì SHA-256 hash generation  
- `os` ‚Äì File and folder handling  
- Python ‚Äì File I/O and logic  
- IDEL ‚Äì Used to run and test the script

## üß™ HOW TO PERFORM THIS PRACTICAL

 1) Create a folder (e.g., Q_1) and add:
                    file_integrity.py
                    Test files like test.txt
                  
 2) Open file_integrity.py in IDEL and run it.
                  
 3) Choose:
     1. to save hashes (first time)
     2. to check file integrity
                  
 4) Enter the folder path when asked.
                  
 5) It will show which files are OK, CHANGED, or MISSING.
